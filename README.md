# OfflineAPISample

Sample app using IGDB.com APIs to illustrate how to work with APIs when you don't have an internet connection. Makes use of [OHHTTPStubs](https://github.com/AliSoftware/OHHTTPStubs) to replace remote calls with lookups for local files.

Make sure to copy `Keys-example.plist` to `Keys.plist` and add your own IGDB.com API key.
